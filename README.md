## Traffic and congestion prediction on LTE networks

### Overview
To handle the dramatic increase in data volume and better serve their customers, mobile network operators need to design and manage network architectures according to the required demand.
A nationwide cellular mobile network contains tens of thousands of base stations. Estimating the traffic increment and consequent congestion of each of these elements can become an arduous and imprecise task, and can lead to incorrect investment decisions. An automation of this methodology means greater speed and standardization of decision making, serving as a great help to both the technical and marketing areas.
